I am currently a postdoctoral scholar working with <a href="https://www.eigensteve.com/"> Prof. Steven L. Brunton</a> at the <a href="https://dynamicsai.org/">AI Institute in Dynamical Systems</a>, University of Washington (USA), specializing in data-driven modeling and control of complex multiphysical systems. My research primarily focuses on data-driven model discovery, the study of irregular geometries, and the application of machine learning to streamline complex optimization tasks in engineering. I earned a B.S. in Energy Engineering from the University of Vigo (2019) and a M.S. in Industrial Mathematics from a consortium of institutions (UVigo, UDC, USC, UPM, UC3M) in 2021. In 2024, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Vigo, focusing on data-driven surrogate models for optimizing enhanced heat transfer applications. During my Ph.D. studies, I undertook a three-month research stay at the University of Melbourne, Australia, where she collaborated with <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/742813-richard-sandberg">Prof. Richard Sandbergâ€™s group</a>. There, I contributed to the development of surrogate models for microfinned surfaces using the group's in-house machine learning framework, EVE3, based on evolutionary algorithms.
