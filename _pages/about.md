I am currently a postdoctoral scholar working with <a href="https://www.eigensteve.com/">Steve Brunton</a> at the <a href="https://dynamicsai.org/">AI Institute in Dynamical Systems</a>, University of Washington (USA), specializing in data-driven modeling and control of complex multiphysical systems. My research primarily focuses on data-driven model discovery, the study of irregular geometries, and the application of machine learning to streamline complex optimization tasks in engineering. 

I earned a B.S. in Energy Engineering from the <a href="https://www.uvigo.gal/en">University of Vigo</a> (2019) and a M.S. in Industrial Mathematics from a consortium of institutions -UVigo (Vigo), UDC (A Coruña), USC (Santiago de Compostela), UPM (Madrid) and UC3M (Madrid)- in 2021. In 2024, I completed my Ph.D. working in the Energy Technology Group (<a href="[https://www.uvigo.gal/en](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gteuvigo/posts/?feedView=all)">GTE</a>) at the University of Vigo, focusing on data-driven surrogate models for optimizing enhanced heat transfer applications. 

Throughout my academic journey, I've always looked for opportunities to learn more by collaborating with researchers from all over the world! During my undergrad, I spent an entire year at the Norwegian University of Science and Techonoly (NTNU), where I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.uvigo.gal/en](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/armin.hafner)">Armin Hafner</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yosr-allouche-ph-d-6465831b/?originalSubdomain=fr)">Yosr Allouche</a>. There, I contributed on the development of a cold thermal energy storage, integrated into a R744 supermarket refrigeration system. Later, during my Ph.D. studies, I also completed a three-month research stay at the <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne (Australia)</a>., where she collaborated with <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/742813-richard-sandberg">Richard Sandberg’s group</a>. There, I contributed to the development of surrogate models for microfinned surfaces using the group's in-house machine learning framework, EVE3, based on evolutionary algorithms.
